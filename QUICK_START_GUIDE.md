# Quick Start Guide: Weight-Based Feeding Rate Calculator

## What's New?

The Tube Feed Tracker now includes a **Weight-Based Feeding Rate Calculator** tab that helps you calculate personalized enteral nutrition feeding rates based on patient weight and nutritional guidelines from the UT Health Surgery Department.

## Where to Find It

1. Open the Tube Feed Tracker app
2. Look for the new **"Feeding Rate"** tab (or Scale icon ⚖️ on mobile)
3. You now have 4 tabs total:
   - **Calculator** - Original basic rate calculator
   - **Feeding Rate** ← **NEW!**
   - **Formulas** - Formula database
   - **Log** - History

## How to Use It (4 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Read the Medical Disclaimer ⚠️

The red disclaimer section at the top explains:
- This calculator is for **reference only**
- Always follow your **doctor's orders**
- Individual needs may vary

**This is important!** Make sure to understand that this tool helps you understand the math, but your medical team's specific instructions always come first.

### Step 2: Enter Patient Information

Fill in three simple fields:

1. **Weight:** Patient's weight (automatic conversion between units!)
   - Enter in **Kilograms (kg)**: Example: 70 kg
   - OR enter in **Pounds (lbs)**: Example: 154 lbs
   - 💡 **Tip:** If you enter the weight in one unit, it automatically converts to the other!

2. **Height:** Patient's height (automatic conversion between units!)
   - Enter in **Centimeters (cm)**: Example: 170 cm
   - OR enter in **Inches (in)**: Example: 67 inches
   - 💡 **Tip:** If you enter the height in one unit, it automatically converts to the other!
   - *OR* skip this and enter BMI if you already have it

3. **Formula Type:** Choose from dropdown
   - Standard Formula (1.0 cal/mL) - most common
   - Peptamen AF (1.2 cal/mL) - high calorie
   - Impact Peptide 1.5 (1.5 cal/mL) - highest calorie

### Step 3: Click "Calculate"

The app will:
- Calculate BMI
- Determine daily caloric needs
- Figure out how much volume is needed per day
- Calculate the goal feeding rate (mL/hour)

### Step 4: Review the Results

You'll see:

#### Key Results Card (Green)
- **Daily Caloric Needs:** How many calories patient needs per day
- **Daily Volume:** Total mL to give over 24 hours
- **Goal Feeding Rate:** Target mL per hour
- **Time to Goal:** Hours to reach full speed with standard advancement

#### Feeding Protocol (Purple)
Shows the step-by-step advancement:
- Start at 20 mL/hr
- Increase by 20 mL every 4 hours
- Until you reach the goal rate

Example: If goal is 90 mL/hr:
- Hour 0: Start 20 mL/hr
- Hour 4: Advance to 40 mL/hr
- Hour 8: Advance to 60 mL/hr
- Hour 12: Advance to 80 mL/hr
- Hour 16: Advance to 90 mL/hr (goal reached!)
- Every 4 hours: 30 mL water flush

## Example Calculation

**Patient Information:**
- Weight: 70 kg
- Height: 170 cm (BMI = 24.2 - normal range)
- Formula: Standard (1.0 cal/mL)

**Results:**
- Daily Calories Needed: 2,100 kcal/day
- Daily Volume: 2,100 mL
- Goal Rate: 87.5 mL/hr (~87-88 mL/hr in practice)
- Time to Goal: About 24 hours with standard advancement

**Protocol:**
- Hour 0: 20 mL/hr
- Hour 4: 40 mL/hr
- Hour 8: 60 mL/hr
- Hour 12: 80 mL/hr
- Hour 16: 87.5 mL/hr (goal!)
- Plus: 30 mL water flush every 4 hours
