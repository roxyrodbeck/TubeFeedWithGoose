FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

1. WEIGHT-BASED CALORIC NEEDS CALCULATOR
   ✓ Input: Weight (kg), Height (cm) or BMI
   ✓ Calculate BMI from weight/height
   ✓ Differentiate between normal and overweight patients
   ✓ Use formula: Weight × 30 kcal/kg/day (normal)
   ✓ Use formula: (IBW + 10%) × 30 kcal/kg/day (overweight)
   ✓ Output: Daily caloric needs

2. GOAL FEEDING RATE CALCULATOR
   ✓ Formula options:
     - Standard Formula: 1.0 kcal/mL
     - Peptamen AF: 1.2 kcal/mL
     - Impact Peptide 1.5: 1.5 kcal/mL
   ✓ Calculate daily volume: Calories ÷ Formula calories
   ✓ Calculate goal rate: Volume ÷ 24 hours
   ✓ Output: mL/hour and total daily volume

3. FEEDING PROTOCOL DISPLAY
   ✓ Show standard advancement schedule
   ✓ Starting rate: 20 mL/hr
   ✓ Advancement: +20 mL every 4 hours
   ✓ Timeline to reach goal
   ✓ Water flush: 30 mL every 4 hours
   ✓ Generate protocol dynamically based on goal rate

4. CALCULATION BREAKDOWN
   ✓ Show patient assessment (weight, height, BMI, IBW)
   ✓ Show caloric calculation with formula
   ✓ Show volume & rate calculation with formula
   ✓ Expandable/collapsible section
   ✓ Help users understand the math

5. MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
   ✓ Prominent red alert section
   ✓ Required legal language
   ✓ Visible by default
   ✓ Expandable for more details
   ✓ Explains UT Health algorithm reference
   ✓ States: "Should not replace doctor's orders"
   ✓ Recommends: "Follow medical team's plan"

6. USER EXPERIENCE
   ✓ Mobile-friendly responsive design
   ✓ Dark mode support
   ✓ Expandable/collapsible sections
   ✓ Clear labels and help tooltips
   ✓ Step-by-step calculation breakdown
   ✓ Color-coded sections
   ✓ Touch-friendly buttons
   ✓ Fast calculations (client-side)

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

ALGORITHM:
1. Patient enters weight and height (or BMI)
2. App calculates BMI if not provided
3. Determines if patient is normal weight or overweight
4. Calculates daily caloric needs:
   - Normal: Weight × 30 kcal/kg/day
   - Overweight: (IBW + 10%) × 30 kcal/kg/day
5. User selects formula type
6. App calculates daily volume: Calories ÷ Formula calories
7. App calculates goal rate: Volume ÷ 24 hours
8. App generates advancement protocol:
   - Start: 20 mL/hr
   - Advance: +20 mL every 4 hours
   - Until: Goal rate reached
9. Display all results with explanations

IDEAL BODY WEIGHT (IBW):
- Uses simplified Devine formula
- IBW = 48 + 0.91 × (height in cm - 152.4)
- Used for overweight patients to avoid over-feeding

CALORIC CALCULATION:
- Standard guideline: 30 kcal/kg/day for enteral nutrition
- Normal weight: Use actual weight
- Overweight: Use IBW + 10% to account for excess body mass
